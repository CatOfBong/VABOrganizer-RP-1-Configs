VAB Organizer - RP-1 Configs

Having recently discovered VAB Organizer by Nertea I was convinced this would be of great benefit RP-1.

Currently the engines are organized along their tech lines, there are subcategories for ORSC engines, Hyrdrolox, Electric and Nuclear. There are additional subcategories for Ground lit engines and Orbital Rocketry engines.

This is a WIP, yes there are gaps but its an ongoing developement.

Feedback is really appreciated, share yours with me on the Forums, the RealSolarSystem Reddit or the RP-1 Discord!

Safe to add and remove to an existing save.

I will only be offering support to the default RP-1 Express Install

Dependencies:
Module Manager
RP-1 Realistic Progression One
